# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a Computer Science major at Georgia Institute of Technology with concentrations in Devices and Intelligence. I will complete my Bachelor's degree in December 2023 and will be starting my Masters in Machine Learning in January 2024. I have experience in full-stack software development, backend development, AI models and am looking to expand my skills through an internship for Summer 2024.
<br>
<br>
This past summer, I interned at BerkOne as a Software Engineering Intern, gaining valuable insights into full-stack development. There, I was able to expedite their hiring process by 65% by creating an Employee Requisition screen using ASP.NET, C#, and MS SQL Server. 
<br>
<br>
In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and various other racquet sports. In addition, I love spending time outdoors and often go on hikes to explore new trails, or biking to... just have fun!
